# Obsidian Pages

This repo allows to easily add markdown pages to your website. (Its written specifically for Obsidian, but any kind of markdown will work) 

Its supposed to be easy to maintain.
The hardest part should be the Deployment. 
After that it should be as easy as placing your vaults into the pages-Folder.
